Travis Langley argues in Batman and Psychology: A Dark and Stormy Knight that the concept of archetypes as described by psychologists Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell is seen in the Batman mythos, such that the character represents the "Shadow archetype".
This archetype, according to Langley, represents a person's own dark side; it is not necessarily an evil one, but rather one that is hidden from the outside and concealed from both the world and oneself.
Langley argues that Bruce Wayne confronts his own darkness early in life; he chooses to use it to instill fear in wrongdoers, with his bright and dark sides working together to fight evil.
Langley uses the Jungian perspective to assert that Batman appeals to our own need to face our "Shadow selves".
